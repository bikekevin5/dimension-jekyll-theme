Toeing the line between novelty and tradition, imagination and calculation, Kevin approaches art like a science, applying technical ability with creative intuition to solve all kinds of problems from technology to stagecraft.

His first play premiered in San Francisco at Bindlestiff Studio. Titled "Lunar New Year," the story explores the line between tolerance and tradition as father and son experience a uniquely San Franciscan Chinese New Year. On top of writing and directing the script, Kevin also coded the website to promote the show and is working on a new iteration to be premiered soon. He will also continue working with local theatre companies to develop new work and push the reach of traditional art forms into new mediums.

His other creative project is the Behave Boys Webseries which will be making its premiere soon. Recruiting now.

Kevin's latest technological project is developing the codebase for a online community literary journal call Wokshop - the Asian Wriers Workshop. This non-profit project is anticipated to help advance the needs of the Asian American diaspora worldwide and his initial workshop already served more than 55 individuals.

Kevin would like to thank:
