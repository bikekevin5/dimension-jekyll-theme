# focus on writing content here
# brainstorm a little bit. what is the purpose of this landing page. who's gonna see it? what's the purpose of it?

# let's say that you want people to what. hire you? see you as a web designer? chance this to an about page, don't waste an extra page
# but use this space wisely. you want to talk about web development, design - you want to talk about playwriting, and you want to talk about botany, and you want to tlk about
# what other aspects can you discuss, your accounting analyst backgrounds
# and mayb eyou can go with the theme of growth and talk about how you're always looking for something new
# so really you want a three paragraph biography - kind of like a general cover letter
# a little bit about you, some overview, then details about wha tyou can do for the client
# then end with some fun notes, a way to contac tyou , and some relatable content
