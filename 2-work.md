Kevin's latest web project is an online community journal for the Asian diaspora worldwide.

Currently recruiting for the Behave Boys webseries!

Projects: Maybe find another theme to finish the LNY website, and once you have that you can come back and develop this landing page to include that. Also think about what kind of work you want to do. Including - marketing? web design? what can you offer potential clients? what is your technical expertise? what is the value you are offering? maybe think about reading more into chris do as well as a recommendation that your buddy mike gave you

also think about the plant databases you were working on! outsource the coding part, dont' work so hard find teh right tools and just put them into place.
